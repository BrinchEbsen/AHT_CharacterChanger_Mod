# Spyro: A Hero's Tail - Character Changer Mod
This mod provides a custom menu to the game which lets you change character at any time. Use with caution, it does not fix any of the issues that occur when you do this.

Sgt. Byrd and Sparx will crash the game if they die outside of a minigame level.

Created using Composer's [code injection utility](https://github.com/C0mposer/C-Game-Modding-Utility).

## Usage
Double-press Z to open the menu. Double-press Z again or press B to close the menu.

Use Dpad/Left stick up and down to select different options. Press A to confirm the character you want to switch to. The game may have to spend a bit of time loading assets before the change happens.
