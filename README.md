# Spyro: A Hero's Tail - Character Changer Mod
This mod provides a custom menu to the game which lets you change character at any time.

Use with caution. While some crashes that are caused by using unintended characters have been fixed, crashes or softlocks may still occur.

Created using Composer's [code injection utility](https://github.com/C0mposer/C-Game-Modding-Utility).

## Compatibility
Currently only compatible with the GameCube US version (G5SE7D).

## Usage
Double-press Z to open the menu. Double-press Z again or press B to close the menu.

Use Dpad/Left stick up and down to select different options. Press A to confirm the character you want to switch to. The game may have to spend a bit of time loading assets before the change happens.

While in the menu, press the X button to enable/disable the Scanmode feature. This will let you toggle a sort of "noclip" mode that lets you fly freely through the map. When Scanmode is enabled, hold any direction on the d-pad and press Z to toggle it.
